    <p>Wendy Osborne has a passion for teaching and mentoring youth. She studied Music Education at the University of Utah, and has been an active private music teacher teaching viola, violin, voice, and piano for over 25 years. She is a registered Suzuki violin/viola teacher, and a Certified Level 1 voice teacher with the Institute of Vocal Advancement. She has served on the boards of the Suzuki Association of Utah and the Pikes Peak Suzuki Association, and is currently the Director of Choirs for Southern Nevada Homeschool Performing Arts. </p>
    <p>As a homeschooling mother and mentor she has mentored dozens of youth in their studies of Shakespeare, theater, history, public speaking, and music. She has directed youth productions of Taming of the Shrew, Much Ado About Nothing, Comedy of Errors, and As You Like It. She enjoys volunteering with youth arts organizations such as Deseret Strings and Harps, Zion’s Youth Symphony and Chorus, and the Las Vegas Desert Suzuki Institute.</p>
    <p>Wendy loves any opportunity to share the stage with her three oldest children, Johnathan (21), Emily (18), and Elisabeth (16) who are all accomplished musicians themselves.  (Michael is only 4, but he has his eyes on the cello!)  She is forever grateful for the love and encouragement of her husband Rob, who is “the ultimate roadie,” and who still manages a good attitude despite his wife’s addiction to music.</p>
