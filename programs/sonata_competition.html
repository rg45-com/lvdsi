  <p>Open to all registered flute and piano students, the 2018 Sonata Competition will be a wonderful opportunity to polish a chosen Sonata movement(s) and experience the audition video recording process. There will be one (1) winner of each movement and all winners will perform on the Wednesday lunch recital with piano accompaniment. Students may be winner of only one movement. All <strong>VIDEO</strong> auditions must be submitted no later than Monday, June 25, 2018. Winners will be notified by July 1, 2018. Flute students may submit auditions with or without piano accompaniment. Memorization is encouraged.</p>
  
  <p>Students should pay attention to the quality of video, sound, and should be dressed for a performance, and their full body should be visible. Please announce your name and the name of your piece at the start of your recording. Send a link to the video (YouTube or otherwise) to the following email address: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>.</p>
