  <p>Classes will be divided by playing level and ensemble music will be sent ahead of time. Suzuki Flute Book 1 students may not have ensemble music to learn ahead of time. Flute students who own a piccolo, alto flute or bass flute are encouraged to bring them to the ensemble class and the technique class. All flute ensemble classes and the Suzuki Flute Repertoire Class will perform on the Final Concert on Thursday night.</p>
  
  <p>All flute students are invited to audition for our Honors Recital, winners performing Tuesday afternoon, and the Sonata Competition, winners performing Wednesday afternoon. For specific audition information, please see our Honors Recital and Sonata Competition page.</p>
  
  <p>Non-Suzuki trained students are welcome to participate in our flute camp! Suzuki Flute Repertoire Class  is the only Suzuki-specific class, and the repertoire will be sent ahead of time. Come and join us for an inspiring and invaluable workshop that will propel your skills into the next school season!</p>
