  <p><span class="firstletter">W</span>e are excited to be sponsoring a Scholarship Raffle during the music institute this year. Items will be included that appeal to both our young students as well as parents and teachers. Be sure to check out our wonderful array of gift certificates, musical treasures and more. Tickets will be sold for $0.50c each. The winners' names will be drawn and announced during the concert on Friday, July 12.</p>

  <p>Last year, our faculty and several orchestra members donated to our scholarship fund and raised enough money to sponsor a $150.00 student scholarship for this year's camp. We hope you support our raffle to help students attend the {{ site.next_year }} LVDSI!</p>
